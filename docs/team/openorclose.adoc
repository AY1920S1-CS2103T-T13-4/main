== Project: Mark (adapted from AddressBook - Level 3)

'''

== Introduction

This project portfolio aims to document my contributions to Mark, a project by my team of 5 Computer Science students from NUS.

Adapted from AddressBook - Level 3, Mark is a user-friendly bookmark manager application targeted at *NUS Computing students*, mainly for use on a computer and for students who prefer getting things done by typing out commands.

Here are some key features of Mark:

- Save and annotate content from a website for convenient offline access

- Set reminders for your to-dos

- Organize your bookmarks automatically


== Contribution Summary

This section serves to describe some of contributions I made to the development of Mark, such as enhancements, documentation, and code reviews.

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *folders in a hierarchical structure* to organize bookmarks:
** What it does: Allows users to have an alternate organization of their bookmarks, instead of showing all of them in
one long list and having to search for them.
** Justification: Users are familiar with organising their files on a computer into folders, so providing this functionality makes their transition to Mark smoother.
** Highlights: This enhancement required knowledge of data structures and algorithms, as displaying, transforming, and other interactions with the folder hierarchy was quite challenging.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a caching command that allows the user to "download" an copy of a website, for access when there is limited internet access.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
