== Overview
This is the portfolio of *TSAI, HSIAO-HAN*, a team member of *Mark*. +
The portfolio will introduce my role and contribution in Mark.

*Mark* is a *desktop bookmark manager* used for organising websites.
The user interacts with it using a *Command Line Interface* (CLI),
and it uses a *Graphical User Interface* (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in *Java*.

This is what our app looks like: +

My role is to design and implement the `reminder` feature.
The following section will illustrate more about this feature.
More details about it are provided in the part of related User and Developer Guide.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add, edit and delete reminders.*
** What it does: allows the user to add a reminder of the bookmark.
                 User can also edit or delete it.
** Justification: This feature enhances the product that can show the time and note of a certain bookmark.
                    User can use it to plan when to read the bookmark.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
