== PROJECT: Mark

---

== Overview
This document will introduce my role and contribution in Mark.
Mark is a 6 weeks group project for the module CS2103T Software Engineering.
Our team composed of 5 NUS Computer Science year 2 students.
We have a team meeting every Tuesday and Thursday.
From this project, we learn the skill of designing a Java application with basic CRUD structure,
working on git,
distributing works on Github,
negotiating and teamwork.


Mark is a __desktop bookmark manage__r used for organising websites.
This application can help the user organize websites by bookmarks,
manage the bookmarks into folders,
take note on the offline copy and set reminders for the task.
The user interacts with Mark using a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI),
and it uses a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI) created with JavaFX.
Mark is written in _Java_.

This is what our app looks like: +

My role is to design and implement the `reminder` feature.
The following section will illustrate more about this feature.
More details about it are provided in the part of related User and Developer Guide.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

NOTE: Represents the things you need to notice.

`reminder`: Represents the command.

****
* `Tag` : Represents the constraints of the command.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: +
added *the ability to add, edit, delete and goto reminders.*
** What it does: allows the user to add a reminder to a specific bookmark.
The reminder will remind users at the time they indicate.
Users can also edit and delete it, or even using reminder to open the bookmark .
** Justification: When users want to plan to read or do some task on bookmark,
this feature can provide them a better way to plan and organize their task,
and they would not forget to doing it.
** Highlights: This feature will help the user automatically cleanup expired reminders after one hour,
so they do not need to bother themselves to delete it. The notification will show up twice,
the first time will show before five hour to leave users some time before the deadline.
Even if users do not close the notification, the notification will disappear after one minute.
** Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44474391/how-to-get-a-scheduled-event-to-interact-with-javafx-gui[Stackoverflow]
gives me the idea of how to implement a reminder notification.

+
Improved current `delete` command so that when a bookmark been deleted it's reminder will also deleted.
