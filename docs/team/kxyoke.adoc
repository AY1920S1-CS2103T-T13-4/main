== Overview

This project portfolio showcases my contributions as part of my team consisting 5 Year 2 Computer Science students to our group Software Engineering project, Mark. We were tasked
with enhancing a basic desktop application, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book (Level 3)], in short AB3, to solve a problem for a specific target group.
AB3 uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) where users type their commands to navigate and use the application.

Given 8 weeks to conceptualise and complete the project implemented in Java, we chose to morph AB3 into a bookmark manager application which we named *Mark*.
Mark aims to improve computing students' productivity by helping them organise their web browsing and note-taking activities. With Mark, computing students can greatly reduce the number of
tabs left open due to various reasons in their web browsers and provides a one-stop platform to allow them to easily pick up their revision through easy navigation and in-built web page
annotation when rushing for time.

Mark has a visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) to visually guide the users around the application. This is what Mark looks like when you open the application:
//TODO: replace gui pic with well populated data

My role was to design and implement the _annotation_ feature so users can conveniently make notes on
important web pages instantly while reading them. This feature uses commands that begin with `annotate` and works on the offline version
of the web pages converted by Mark.

The following sections illustrate my contributions in more detail. The relevant documentation I have added to the User and Developer Guides in relation to this enhancement is also included in this portfolio.

== Summary of contributions
This section gives a summary of the features I implemented, documentation I did and other parts I contributed to my team project.

=== Major enhancements added
I have made 2 major enhancements: adding the annotation functionality and adding the in-built web browser.

==== Added the annotation feature
I added the ability to annotate the offline copy of the web page referred to by a bookmark. Users can not only read their web pages offline,
but they can also make notes on them directly. They can highlight paragraphs and attach notes to paragraphs or add general notes to the document.
//** What it does

* Justification: Users may need to make notes as they are reading through their web pages, for instance when studying. This means it is important for them
to be able to conveniently make notes while they remember what they need to annotate. Rather than having to go through the hassle of opening a new document and storing notes
separately, they can instead annotate directly on the web page the moment they want to add notes or emphasize a piece of information.
This feature keeps their notes together with the content of the web page and makes it easy to get information by taking a glance at the annotated document. If they want to make changes to their
existing annotations, they can also do so easily in just one step.

* Highlights: This enhancement works with `undo` and redo` commands, which makes note-taking very assuring. The implementation was rather challenging
because to support annotations, the offline document has to take into account different kinds of paragraphs, each having a unique set of restrictions.
The functionality implemented is also massive. Nevertheless,
the completed annotation feature works well and is aesthetically pleasing on the application.
* Credits: I used the https://jsoup.org/[JSoup library] to extract the contents of the paragraphs of the web page, which is first parsed using the https://github.com/dankito/Readability4J[Readability4J library]. Colours of the highlight are selected from the javafx css extension.

==== Added the web browsing feature
I added the ability to browse web pages on the application. Users can navigate the web using the embedded web view and the address bar.

* Justification: Users no longer need to open a separate web browser window to view their bookmarks. This ensures easy navigation within the application by maintaining focus on the application
rather than on other platforms, which would otherwise make it more troublesome to do bookmarking, web browsing and note-taking at the same time.

* Highlights: This enhancement allows users to browse directly on the application. This is crucial as they can now directly bookmark the web page they are currently viewing without having to copy the url, switch to Mark and add the bookmark manually.
Implementation wise, embedding the web view was not difficult. However, design of the GUI was tedious especially due to the initial lack of expertise on using JavaFX.

* Credits: I took inspiration from the web view embedded in https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[Address Book (Level 4)], which was not navigable as a user would expect of a browser.


=== Minor enhancement added
In addition to the major enhancements I made, I also created tabs to lay down the various parts of the user interface that we show to the user.

==== Added tab view
I created tabs and added the ability to switch views from tab to tab.

* Justification: An organised interface will help users get familiarised fast and improve their quality of use of the application. Hence, tabs are necessary to declutter the GUI so each component has sufficient space for users to view them in comfort.

* Highlights: This enhancement leaves much room for customization and personalization for future work.
