== PROJECT: Mark â€“ Bookmark Manager

== Overview

My team of 5 software engineering students was tasked with morphing an existing Command Line Interface (CLI)
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[desktop application]
into a useful application for a specific target group. We chose to create a bookmark manager application
known as Mark, which is intended for computing students. Mark was conceptualised and implemented over a period of
8 weeks. It is written in Java and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that was created using JavaFX.

This is what Mark looks like:

My role as a developer was to design and implement the `autotag` feature. I also implemented the `import` and `export`
features and contributed to various team tasks.

The following sections illustrate these contributions in more detail and showcase documentation that I added to
the User and Developer Guides in relation to the enhancements made.

== Summary of contributions

This section provides a summary of my contributions in terms of code, documentation and other team-related matters.

=== Enhancements added
* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *tag bookmarks automatically* based on specific conditions
** Description
*** The `autotag` mechanism applies autotags to bookmarks based on a set of criteria, known as autotag conditions.
Mark contains a list of predeclared autotags, and the user can also create custom autotags if desired.
** Justification
*** It is troublesome for users to have to manually add tags every time they add or edit a bookmark, especially when
multiple bookmarks need to be tagged similarly.
The autotag feature allows them to tag similar bookmarks in one command, as well as set up tagging system that will
continue to categorise bookmarks automatically. This makes it easier to find important information at a glance when
searching for tags.
** Highlights
*** Designing this feature required significant planning regarding the design of the automatic tagging mechanism and
how autotags should be stored.
*** Implementing this feature involved development in all components of the project: starting with
creating the mechanism in the Model and Logic components, then enabling the saving of autotags in Storage,
and finally making autotags visible in the UI component.
** Credits
*** One of my team members contributed a more elegant solution to combine autotag conditions, which I adopted
in my implementation.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to *export* data from and *import* bookmarks into Mark.
** Description
*** The `export` command saves all of Mark's data to a given file on the hard disk.
*** The `import` command imports bookmarks from a specified file into Mark.
** Justification
*** Users may want to preserve old bookmarks without cluttering their current Mark dashboard. This can be
done by exporting all current Mark data to a file on the hard disk. Bookmarks can then be imported from any
previously-saved file whenever they are needed.
** Highlights
*** The `import` command required different elements in Mark to be considered, including folders. While the final
choice of implementation only imports bookmarks, the handling of other components had to be considered when
planning this enhancement.
