== PROJECT: Mark (Bookmark Manager)

:sectnums:

== Overview

My team of 5 software engineering students was tasked with morphing an existing Command Line Interface (CLI)
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[desktop application]
into a useful application for a specific target group. We opted to create a bookmark manager to help computing students
manage their web browsing activities.

This is what our product, Mark, looks like:

Our product, Mark, was conceptualised and implemented over a period of 8 weeks. My role as a developer was to design and
implement a mechanism to allow bookmarks to be categorised automatically. I also improved Mark's storage functionality
and contributed to various team tasks. The following sections describe these contributions in more detail.

== Summary of contributions

This section summarizes my code, documentation, and team-related contributions to Mark.

*Major feature*: I implemented the *autotag* mechanism to facilitate the automatic categorisation of bookmarks.

* _What it does_: Allows bookmarks to be tagged without user input based on a predefined set of conditions.
* _Justification_: Organising bookmarks is time-consuming as bookmarks must be edited individually. This enhancement
allows users to categorise their bookmarks in a few simple steps.
* _Highlights_: Designing the autotag mechanism and how autotag conditions should be stored
required significant planning. In addition, this feature involved development in all major components of
Mark.

*Minor feature*: I enhanced Mark's existing storage system by adding the capacity to *export* and *import* bookmarks.
It allows users to save and retrieve bookmarks from different files on the hard disk without exiting Mark, so that
they can preserve old bookmarks without cluttering their current dashboard.
