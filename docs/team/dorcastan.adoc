== PROJECT: Mark (Bookmark Manager)

:sectnums:

== Overview

My team of 5 software engineering students was tasked with morphing an existing Command Line Interface (CLI)
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[desktop application]
into a useful application for a specific target group. We opted to create a bookmark manager to help computing students
manage their web browsing activities.

This is what our product, Mark, looks like:

Mark was conceptualised and implemented over a period of 8 weeks. My role as a developer was to design and
implement a mechanism to allow bookmarks to be categorised automatically. I also implemented the `import` and `export`
features and contributed to various team tasks.

The following sections illustrate these contributions in more detail and showcase documentation that I added to
the User and Developer Guides in relation to the enhancements made.

A few special icons are used in the documentation sections below. These are what they denote:

== Summary of contributions

This section provides a summary of my code, documentation, and team-related contributions to Mark.

*Major feature*: I implemented the *autotag* mechanism to facilitate the automatic categorisation of bookmarks.

* _What it does_: Allows bookmarks to be tagged without user input based on a predefined set of conditions.
* _Justification_: Organising bookmarks is time-consuming as bookmarks must be edited individually. This enhancement
allows users to categorise their bookmarks in a few simple steps.
* _Highlights_: Designing the autotag mechanism and how autotag conditions should be stored
required significant planning. In addition, this feature involved development in all major components of
Mark.
* _Credits_: My team member Daryl suggested a more elegant way to combine autotag conditions, which was adapted in the
final implementation.

*Minor feature*: I enhanced Mark's existing storage system by adding the capacity to *export* and *import* bookmarks.

* _What it does_: Allows users to save and retrieve bookmarks from different files on the hard disk without exiting Mark.
* _Justification_: Users may want to preserve old bookmarks without cluttering their current dashboard. This enhancement
allows them to save copies of bookmarks which can be easily accessed when needed.
* _Highlights_: Ensuring that imported bookmark data remained compatible with other components like folders was tricky.
