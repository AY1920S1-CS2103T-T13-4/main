== Introduction

Mark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing
bookmarks*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mark
can get your bookmark organisation and note-taking done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to
<<Quick Start>> to get
started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Here are a few steps to get you started on Mark: +

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Bookmark Manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all bookmarks
* *`add u/git-scm.com/book/en/v2 n/Pro Git f/Tutorials`* : adds a bookmark
named `Pro Git` to the Bookmark Manager.
* *`delete 3`* : deletes the 3rd bookmark shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details
of each command.

****
* At least one condition (`u/`,
`nu/`, `f/`, `nf/`, `t/`, or `nt/`) must be specified.
* If an autotag with name `NAME` already exists, the user is asked
whether conditions for `NAME` should be overwritten.
* An autotag is applied when a bookmark matches all of its conditions.
Hence, if conditions are contradictory, no bookmarks will be tagged by
this autotag. E.g. no bookmarks will match the conditions `u/github.com/mark
nu/github.com/mark`
* `PARTIAL_URL` and `NOT_PARTIAL_URL` can be any part of a URL. E.g.
 `youtube`, `.nus.edu.sg`, or `github.com/mark`.
* `NOT_PARTIAL_URL`, `NOT_FOLDER`, and `NOT_TAG` are partial URLs, folders,
or tags that bookmarks to be tagged should *not* match.
* The tag `NAME` is still a normal tag. E.g. if an autotag `YouTube` matches
bookmarks with URLs containing `youtube.com`, other bookmarks can still be
tagged with the tag `YouTube`.
****

Examples:

* `*autotag* Miscellaneous f/NUS nt/academic nt/admin` +
 Creates an autotag that adds the tag `Miscellaneous` to all bookmarks that are
in the folder `NUS` but are not tagged with `academic` or `admin`.
