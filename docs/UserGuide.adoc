== Introduction

Mark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing
bookmarks*. More importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mark
can get your bookmark organisation and note-taking done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Move on to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

=== Installing Mark

Here are a few steps to get you started on Mark: +

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `mark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Mark.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
// TODO: move this part to <<Using Mark>>
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
+
Here are some example commands that you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all bookmarks
* *`folder Tutorials`* : create a folder named `Tutorials`
* *`add u/https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 n/Pro Git f/Tutorials`* : adds a bookmark
named `Pro Git` to Mark.
* *`delete 3`* : deletes the 3rd bookmark shown in the current bookmark list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mark

This section offers an overview of Mark's layout so that you can locate information more easily.

There are three main areas in Mark:

. A __command box__ at the top of the screen
. A __bookmark list__ on the left of the screen
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the right side of the screen

// TODO: describe properly (this is very 'functional' but may not be user-friendly)
The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the result display box, immediately below the command box.

.The command box and result display box
image::ui-screenshots/CommandBox.png[]

The *_bookmark list_* shows details about the bookmarks in Mark.

.The bookmark list
image::ui-screenshots/BookmarkList.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows one of three available tabs at any point in time.
Mark has three [[Tabs]] tabs: **Dashboard**, **Online** and **Offline**.

* The **Dashboard** tab contains information about reminders, favorite bookmarks,
folders, and autotags in Mark.

====
*Command Format*

This document uses the following notation to describe command formats:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
E.g. In the command format `*add* u/URL`, `URL` is a parameter which can be used as `*add* u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
E.g `u/URL [t/TAG]` can be used as
`u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg t/NUS` or as `u/https://luminus.nus.edu.sg`.
* Default values for optional items are specified with an `=` symbol. +
E.g. When `u/URL [t/TAG=CS2103T]` is specified in the command format, the default value for the tag is `CS2103T` if not
it is not provided.
* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero times. +
E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/module`,
`t/module t/read-later` etc.
* Parameters can be used in any order. +
E.g. if the command specifies `u/URL n/NAME`, `n/NAME u/URL` is also acceptable.

// end::undo-redo-command[]

// tag::exportcommand[]
[[exporting-bookmarks]]
==== Exporting bookmarks: *`export`*

This command exports Mark data to a specified file on the hard disk. The saved file is
identical in format to the data file `mark.json` and can be used to save back-up copies
of Mark data.

Note that Mark data are automatically saved in the hard disk after any command
that changes the data, so if you do not need outdated Mark data, there is no need to
save manually.

'''

// tag::autotags[]
=== Autotags

_Autotags_ are tags that will be automatically applied to bookmarks which match their
respective autotag conditions.
You can view the details of existing autotags in the autotag panel at the bottom-right of
the **Dashboard** tab, as seen below.

.The autotag panel on the Dashboard tab
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagPanel.png[]

The commands in this section provide a way to add and remove autotags in Mark.

// tag::autotagcommand[]
[[Autotag-Command]]
==== Creating an automatic tag: *`autotag`*

If you are looking to tag a group of similar bookmarks without manually editing each one, you
can use the `autotag` command to create an autotag that will do that for you. You can define
the group of bookmarks to be tagged using _conditions_, which describe the key characteristics
of those bookmarks.

NOTE: Conditions fall into two categories: _normal conditions_, which are characteristics that
bookmarks to be tagged should match, and _not-conditions_, which are conditions that bookmarks
should *not* match.

You can specify conditions relating to the name, URL, and/or folder (also known as _attributes_)
of a bookmark. It is also possible not to specify any condition for an attribute if the attribute
is not relevant. However, an autotag must have at least one condition specified; otherwise, it
would automatically tag all your bookmarks!

====
Format: `*autotag* TAG_NAME [n/NAME_KEYWORD]... [u/URL_KEYWORD]... [f/FOLDER]...
[nn/NOT_NAME_KEYWORD]... [nu/NOT_URL_KEYWORD]... [nf/NOT_FOLDER]...`
====

For example:

* To add a new autotag, input `*autotag* NUS n/NUS n/School n/Uni` into the command box.
+
// show dashboard and bookmark list, with some bookmarks named NUS/School/Uni but no tags
// also show the command in the command box
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then check that an autotag named `NUS` with three name conditions (`NUS`, `School`, and `Uni`)
has been added to the autotag panel of the Dashboard. Also, notice that bookmarks with names
that contain `NUS`, `School` or `Uni` now have the tag `NUS`.
+
// show updated dashboard and bookmark list, with the relevant bookmarks having been tagged
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* At least one condition (`n/`, `nn/`, `u/`, `nu/`, `f/`, or `nf/`) must be specified.
* `TAG_NAME` should be a valid tag name. No existing autotag should have this tag name.
However, `TAG_NAME` can still be used as a normal tag. E.g. if an autotag `YouTube` matches
bookmarks with URLs containing `youtube.com`, other bookmarks can still be
tagged with the tag `YouTube`.
* `NAME_KEYWORD` and `URL_KEYWORD` are used to match bookmarks in a similar way
as the keywords in `*find*` (see <<finding-bookmarks>>). The only difference is that a single
keyword parameter can contain multiple words. E.g. `n/Module W` will match names
`CS2103T Module Website` and `module work to do` but not `Future modules`.
* `FOLDER` should be the exact name of a folder (case insensitive). E.g. `wiki` will match
`Wiki` but not `Wikipedia`.
* `NOT_NAME_KEYWORD`, `NOT_URL_KEYWORD`, and `NOT_FOLDER` are name keywords,
URL keywords, or folder names that bookmarks to be tagged should *not* match.
****

IMPORTANT: If an autotag's conditions contradict each other, no bookmarks will be tagged.
E.g. an autotag with conditions `u/github.com/mark nu/github.com/` effectively does nothing as no
bookmark can have a URL containing `github.com/mark` and not `github.com`.

// TODO: move this somewhere else?
[NOTE]
====
If multiple conditions are specified, bookmarks are matched in the following way:
    * For normal conditions (`n/`, `u/`, and `f/`), bookmarks that match at least one condition
    within the same attribute type will be matched (i.e. OR search). E.g. `n/wiki n/comput` will match
    names `WikiHow` and `Computer Science`.
    * For negative conditions (`nn/`, `nu/`, and `nf/`), bookmarks that match all of the conditions
    within the same condition type are matched (i.e. AND search). E.g. `nf/Work nf/School` will
    match bookmarks that are not in the folder `Work` and not in the folder `School`.
    * Bookmarks that match all conditions across different condition types are matched. E.g. `n/web
    n/mod f/NUS` will match bookmarks with [names that match `web` and/or `mod`] AND [are in the
    folder `NUS`].
====

Other examples:

// TODO: add screenshots and improve descriptions
* `*autotag* LumiNUS u/luminus.nus.edu.sg nf/Miscellaneous`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandExample1.png[]
+
Creates an autotag named `LumiNUS` which tags all bookmarks with URLs
containing `luminus.nus.edu.sg` that are not in the folder `Miscellaneous`.

* `*autotag* Quiz f/NUS f/Module nu/github nu/stackoverflow`
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagCommandExample2.png[]
+
Creates an autotag named `Quiz` which tags all bookmarks that are either in
the folder `NUS` or in the folder `Module`, and that do not contain any of the
keywords `github` or `stackoverflow` in their URLs.
// end::autotagcommand[]

==== Deleting an automatic tag: *`autotag-delete`*

If you no longer need an autotag, you can delete it from Mark using the `autotag-delete`
command. None of your existing tags are affected when an autotag is deleted.

Format: `*autotag-delete* TAG_NAME`

For example:

* If you want to delete the autotag `NUS`, input `*autotag-delete* NUS` into the command box.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagDeleteCommandUi1.png[]

* You can then check that the autotag named `NUS` has been deleted from the autotag panel of the Dashboard.
In addition, no bookmarks have been modified.
+
image::ui-screenshots/AutotagDeleteCommandUi2.png[]

Parameter constraints:
****
* `TAG_NAME` should be the name of an existing autotag.
****

Example:

* `*autotag-delete* Quiz` +
 Deletes the autotag that would have tagged bookmarks that match its conditions
with the tag `Quiz`. No existing tags are removed, but new and edited bookmarks
will no longer be automatically tagged with `Quiz`.
// end::autotags[]

'''

=== Offline Copies

The following commands carry out operations relating to <<offline-copy, offline copies>>
of bookmarked web pages.

==== Saving an offline copy: *`cache`*

Saves the bookmarked website locally for offline viewing.

Format: `*cache* INDEX`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to save an offline copy of. If there is a previous version, it will be overwritten.
****

Examples:

* `*cache* 1` +
Saves an offline copy of the first bookmark.

==== Deleting an offline copy: *`cache-delete`*

Deletes an offline copy of a bookmark.

Format: `*cache-delete* INDEX`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to delete the offline copy of. It must have an offline copy to delete.
****

Examples:

* `*cache-delete* 2` +
Deletes the offline copy of the second bookmark.

==== Viewing an offline copy: *`offline`*

If you want to view the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `offline` command. Your view will be switched
to the offline tab where the offline copy is shown.

Format: `*offline* INDEX`
//TODO: [v/VERSION = current]`

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to view notes of
//TODO: * `VERSION` is the version of the cached version to show. Default is the current version
****

Examples:

* `*offline* 1` +
Shows annotated offline copy of bookmark 1.

//TODO: * `*offline* 1 v/2` +
//Shows the 2nd version of offline copy of bookmark 1. If it is annotated,
//then annotations are shown as well.


[[annotate]]
==== Making annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate`*

If you want to add a new annotation on the offline copy of a bookmark,
you can do so using the `annotate` command.
With this command, you can highlight a paragraph on the offline document and
optionally attach a supplementary note to said paragraph. You can add notes
to justify the highlight or as content-relevant notes to refer to in future.

If you are looking to add a general note not pertaining to any specific paragraph, you
can also use this command to add it to the bottom of the page, hereby known as the _General notes section_.

Upon annotating, the your view will be switched to the offline tab
showing the results of your command.

NOTE: A general note is not attached to any paragraph of the original web page. Instead, when adding general notes, they are attached
to newly created paragraphs that do not have any content displayed.
General notes are found at the bottom of the page, referred to as the _General notes section_.

You can choose to use this command to overwrite any existing note. However, note that when you use this command to highlight
the paragraph of a general note, Mark remembers the hidden highlight colour, but no highlight is reflected on the application.

NOTE: Paragraphs are identified using a numbered identifier that starts with either `P` or `G`. You can refer to the
numbered identifier in the leftmost column of the offline document to check out the respective identifier for each paragraph.
Paragraphs of general notes are identified using numbered identifiers that begin with `G`, as opposed to paragraphs originating from the original web page, whose identifiers begin with `P`.

Format: `*annotate* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR=yellow]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate* 1 p/p2 n/summary of paragraph h/orange` into the command box.

image::AddAnnotationCommandUi1.png[]
// offline tab, showing result after   annotate 1 p/p2

* Observe that any pre-existing annotation is overwritten. Paragraph P2 is now highlighted orange and a note with content “summary of paragraph” is attached to it.

image::AddAnnotationCommandUi2.png[]
// offline tab, showing result.


// More details about command constraints
****
 * `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to be marked.
 `PARA_NUM` must be `NULL` or it must begin with `P` or `G` (e.g. `P3`). `PARA_NUM` is case-insensitive.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
 * `NOTES` is the content of notes to add.
 * `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. If no colour is specified,
the colour is set to yellow by default.
If the colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

//TODO: remove all the description of result and replace with GUI image?
Other examples:

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2` +
This highlights paragraph P2 yellow in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 h/pink` +
This overwrites any existing highlight of paragraph P2 with pink
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Any notes attached remain attached.

* `*annotate* 1 p/p2 n/change or add note content` +
This overwrites any note attached to paragraph P2 to a note with content “change or add note content”
in the offline copy of bookmark 1. Highlight
colour remains the same. Otherwise, paragraph P2 will be highlighted yellow and
a new note with content "change or add note content" will be added to the paragraph.

* `*annotate* 1 p/null n/adding a general note` +
This adds a note with content "adding a general note" to the _General notes section_ in the
offline copy of bookmark 1.

[[annotate-edit]]
==== Modifying annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-edit`*

If you want to modify existing annotations on the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-edit` command.
You can choose to overwrite the existing note of a particular paragraph with another note, change the highlight or
choose to move notes from a paragraph to another paragraph. You can also use this command to move a general note to the main text by specifying which original paragraph to move it to.

NOTE: While both `*annotate-edit*` and `*annotate*` can be used to change current annotation highlight and notes, `*annotate-edit*`
allows you to shift your annotations from one paragraph to another in a single step.

Moving of notes to the <<stray-notes, _General notes section_>> is not supported. If you really want to shift them,
use <<annotatedelete, `*annotate-delete*`>> with  `n/true` as the only optional flag you include.

Upon editing an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-edit* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [to/NEW_PARA_NUM] [n/NOTES] [h/HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-edit* 1 p/g1 to/p1 h/green` into the command box.

image::EditAnnotationCommandUi1.png[]
// offline tab after   annotate 1 p/null n/this note was once a general note

* Observe that the general note removed from the bottom and attached to pararaph P1. At the same time, paragraph P1 is highlighted green.

image::EditAnnotationCommandUi2.png[]

****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to annotate offline version of.
If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph which you want to edit annotation of. `PARA_NUM` is case-insensitive.
If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or the corresponding paragraph does not have existing annotations, a warning message will be displayed.
* `NEW_PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to move the annotation to. `NEW_PARA_NUM` is also case-insensitive.
If `NEW_PARA_NUM` is the same as `PARA_NUM` or is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `NOTES` is the content of notes to change to. Whenever notes is given, it
replaces any pre-existing note to paragraph `PARA_NUM`, if applicable.
* `HIGHLIGHT_COLOUR` is either `orange`, `pink`, `green` or `yellow`. This selects
the highlight colour to mark out paragraphs. When no colour is specified, the higlihgt of the source paragraph is
used.
If colour provided is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3` +
This moves both the highlight and notes from paragraph P2 to paragraph P3 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.
The highlight of paragraph P2 is removed.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3 h/orange` +
This moves the note from paragraph P2 to paragraph P3 in the offline copy of bookmark 1. The highlight of paragraph P2
is removed and paragraph P3 is highlighted with orange.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p1 n/new notes` +
This replaces the content of the note for paragraph P1 with "new notes" in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p1 h/yellow` +
This changes the highlight colour to yellow for paragraph P1 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/g2 to/p1` +
This moves the general note G2 to paragraph P1 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-edit* 1 p/p2 to/p3 n/changing and moving notes` +
This annotates paragraph P3 with the highlight of paragraph 2 and
a note with content "changing and moving notes". The annotation on paragraph P2 is removed.

[[annotatedelete]]
==== Deleting annotations on an offline copy: *`annotate-delete`*

If you want to delete highlights or notes from the offline copy of a bookmark, you can do so using the `annotate-delete` command.
You can choose to remove just the notes and/or highlight of a paragraph, or clear all annotations
on the offline copy to revert it to a clean slate. You can also choose to remove a note from the
<<stray-notes,_General notes section_>>.

If the given paragraph does not have any annotations to remove, nothing is performed.
Also, you cannot choose to remove only the highlight from the paragraph of a general note since it does not display a highlight in the first place.

Upon deleting an annotation, your view will be switched to the offline tab showing the results of your command.

Format: `*annotate-delete* INDEX p/PARA_NUM [n/KEEP_NOTES=false] [h/KEEP_HIGHLIGHT=false]`

For example:

* Input `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2 n/true` into the command box.

image::DeleteAnnotationCommandUi1.png[]
// offline tab, after   annotate 1 p/p2 h/pink n/this note is originally not general

* Observe that the highlight of paragraph P2 if removed and the note is moved to the _General notes section_.

image::DeleteAnnotationCommandUi2.png[]


****
* `INDEX` is the bookmark that you want to remove annotations of.
 If `INDEX` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `PARA_NUM` is the numbered identifier of the paragraph to remove annotation(s) from. `PARA_NUM` must be either `all` or begin with `P` or `S`.
 If you entered `all` for this parameter, all annotations will be cleared regardless of other options, reverting the offline document to a clean slate.
 If you specified a phantom paragraph instead, the phantom paragraph will be deleted if `n/KEEP_NOTES` parameter is set to `false`.
 If `PARA_NUM` is invalid or there is no annotation to delete, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_NOTES` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the notes of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the notes will be removed. `KEEP_NOTES` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_NOTES` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
* `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is _boolean_ (either `true` or `false`). If `true`, the highlight of the paragraph will not be deleted. Otherwise,
the highlight will be removed. `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT` is `false` by default.
 If `KEEP_HIGHLIGHT`` is invalid, a warning message will be displayed.
****

Other examples:

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2` +
This removes both the note and highlight from paragraph P2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1.

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/p2 h/true` +
This removes the note of paragraph P2 in the offline copy of bookmark 1, leaving the highlight untouched.

* `*annotate-delete* 2 p/g1` +
This deletes the general note G1 in the offline copy of bookmark 2.

* `*annotate-delete* 1 p/all` +
This removes all annotations of the offline copy of bookmark 1.
